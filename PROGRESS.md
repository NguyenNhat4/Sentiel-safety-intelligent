# Project Progress

This is the single progress tracker for the repository. Completed work is grouped by area; current state, known issues, and next steps are project-wide.

## Current State
- The baseline upload → four-point zone → binary WebSocket inference → foot-point zone review → event save flow is implemented.
- FastAPI serves the build-free frontend at `/` and provides REST plus WebSocket APIs.
- Frontend logic is split into native ES modules with a 29-line composition root.
- Static checks, formatting, WebSocket live smoke tests, ES module linking, and headless-browser loading pass.

## Completed

### Backend
- [x] Established the FastAPI modular monolith, typed settings, SQLAlchemy database layer, REST APIs, and test scaffolding.
- [x] Added safety-event lifecycle, reviewed snapshot persistence, statistics, and Safety Agent endpoints.
- [x] Added YOLO person detection, foot-point polygon evaluation, safety-shirt baseline rule, and REST frame inference.
- [x] Added binary WebSocket inference with configuration, correlation metadata, one-frame processing, validation, and structured errors.
- [x] Documented frontend/backend interaction and the recommended confirmed-warning persistence lifecycle.

### Frontend
- [x] Added local video playback, normalized four-point zone editing, Canvas overlays, and foot-point visualization.
- [x] Added 2 FPS WebSocket inference with one frame in flight and same-origin/port-8000 fallback.
- [x] Pause playback only when a returned person foot point is inside the configured polygon while the machine is running.
- [x] Added actual-violation and false-alarm review actions with REST event persistence.
- [x] After acknowledged save, close the review state and keep the monitor visible; load confirmed snapshots when the operator opens “Nhật ký vi phạm”.
- [x] Added development localhost CORS support for frontend/backend ports.
- [x] Use local SQLite for baseline event persistence and clean up snapshots when a database transaction fails.
- [x] Refactored the 686-line `app.js` into build-free ES modules with a 29-line composition root.
- [x] Restored Play-button activation immediately after video metadata loads.

### Documentation
- [x] Documented current/future project structure, WebSocket contracts, runtime diagrams, and review persistence recommendations.
- [x] Consolidated module tracking into central root `DECISIONS.md` and `PROGRESS.md` files.
- [x] Added new-developer setup, API documentation, testing, and manual smoke-test instructions to the root README.
- [x] Clarified the WebSocket inference input sequence, output fields, decision rule, and common outcomes in the backend README.
- [x] Added a PRD-aligned user story backlog separating completed, partial, and remaining MVP work with acceptance criteria.

## In Progress
- [ ] Replace the controlled-demo safety-shirt color heuristic with trained PPE model weights.

## Known Issues
- The safety-shirt classifier is a color heuristic and is not production PPE detection.
- Review snapshots are not face-blurred yet and currently record `privacy_blurred=false`.
- The pytest suite collects successfully but stalls in the shared `TestClient` flow on the current Python 3.14 environment; focused non-`TestClient` checks and live smoke tests pass.

## Next Steps
1. Replace the safety-shirt heuristic while preserving the inference response contract.
2. Blur faces before any confirmed snapshot is persisted.
3. Implement the PostgreSQL Alembic migration and authenticated Safety Officer identity.
